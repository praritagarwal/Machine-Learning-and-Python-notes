    "At the end of this process my conputer has two jupyter icons. One is called \"Jupyter Notebook\" and the other is called \"Jupyter Notebook (tensorflow_env)\". I think the \"Jupyter Notebook\" icon starts the jupyter notebook in the base environment with the other environment being available to it through the \"Change kernel\" option : Kernel --> Change kernel. The default kernel for any environment is called \"Python3\". On the other hand the \"Jupyter Notebook (tensorflow_env)\" starts the jupyter notebook in the \"tensorflow_env\" environment. It has only the default kernel i.e. Python3. Hence there are no other environments accessible through this. However all the packages installed in the \"tensorflow_env\" environment are available to it. Hence my tensorflow codes run as usual without any problems. "

I am sure this is not because of anaconda installation since things were working fine earlier. I think I'll have to delete and reinstall my user account on windows for things to start working again, but for now I am just going to use the base environment's jupyter notebook.
